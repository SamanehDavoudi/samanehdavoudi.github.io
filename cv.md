## About me

I am a computational biologist specializing in biomolecular simulations, particularly using the coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach. My expertise lies in investigating the interactions between membrane proteins and lipid membranes. However, my main focus in recent years has been on calculating the permeability of drugs across both flat and curved lipid membranes.
