# About

I am a Molecular Modeler, specialized in simulating biological processes using (coarse-grained) molecular dynamics. My research involves the application of Python programming to analyze simulation results. You can find some of the Python codes I've developed for this purpose in my ["here"]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gX_JMSoAAAAJ&hl=en](https://github.com/SamanehDavoudi/Membrane_Analysis)).

If you are interested in knowing more about my academic background and research contributions, please feel free to download my [CV](/cv.pdf). Additionally, you can access the list of my publications by clicking [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gX_JMSoAAAAJ&hl=en).
