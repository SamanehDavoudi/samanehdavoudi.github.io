# About

I am a molecular modeler at Ghent University. My research area is focused on simulating biologoical processes applying (coarse-grained) molecular dynamics. Using python programming, I analyze the results. You can see some of these codes in my ["Membrane_Analysis"]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gX_JMSoAAAAJ&hl=en](https://github.com/SamanehDavoudi/Membrane_Analysis)) repository. [Click here](/cv.pdf) to download my CV. You can also see my publication list [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gX_JMSoAAAAJ&hl=en).
