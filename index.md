# About

This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](/cv) to see the full CV, and [here](/cv.pdf) to download a print version. 

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).
